# TexasAutonmouns
Each subteam will have a folder for their own code and development, work on each system will be done in their own branches.
Once a branch is confirmed to be working and is implemented in the car it will be merged into the main branch.
This let's our main branch be a snapshot of what is currently in the car, and our side branches of future implementations waitng to happen.
